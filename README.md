## Project Overview
Stroke is a significant global health issue and the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. The goal of this project is to develop a stroke prediction model using a dataset that contains various patient attributes such as gender, age, medical history, and lifestyle factors. The model will predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke.

## Dataset
- **id:** Unique patient identifier
- **gender:** "Male", "Female", or "Other"
- **age:** Age of the patient
- **hypertension:** 0 (no hypertension) or 1 (has hypertension)
- **heart_disease:** 0 (no heart disease) or 1 (has heart disease)
- **ever_married:** "No" or "Yes"
- **work_type:** "children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private", or "Self-employed"
- **Residence_type:** "Rural" or "Urban"
- **avg_glucose_level:** Average glucose level in the blood
- **bmi:** Body mass index
- **smoking_status:** "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes", or "Unknown" (if information is not available)
- **stroke:** 1 (patient had a stroke) or 0 (patient didn't have a stroke)

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient is at risk of having a stroke. The project includes the following steps:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation

## Getting Started
